## Example Decision

*Here's a filled-out example to guide you*

## Decision: Use PostgreSQL for User Service Database

**Decision ID**: DEC-2025-10-15-001  
**Date**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Deciders**: [@tech-lead, @architect]  
**Consulted**: [@dev-team, @ops-team]  
**Informed**: [@product-team, @stakeholders]

---

## Context

**What is the issue we're facing?**
We need to select a database for our new user service that will handle user profiles, preferences, and authentication. The service needs to support complex queries, maintain strong consistency, and scale to 1M users.

**Key Factors**:
- Need ACID compliance for user data integrity
- Complex relational queries for user preferences
- Team has more PostgreSQL than MongoDB experience
- Must support JSON for flexible schema sections
- Budget constraints favor open-source solutions

**Assumptions**:
- User growth will be gradual (not sudden spike)
- Read:write ratio will be approximately 80:20

---

## Decision

Use PostgreSQL 14+ as the primary database for the user service.

---

## Rationale

PostgreSQL offers the best balance of features, team expertise, and long-term maintainability.

**Key Benefits**:
1. Strong ACID guarantees ensure data consistency
2. Excellent JSON/JSONB support for flexible fields
3. Team already experienced with PostgreSQL operations
4. Rich query capabilities with full SQL support
5. Open source with strong community and tooling

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
1. Slightly more complex horizontal scaling than some NoSQL options - acceptable given gradual growth
2. Requires careful index management for performance - team has this expertise

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: MongoDB
**Pros**:
- Flexible schema, good for rapid iteration
- Horizontal scaling built-in

**Cons**:
- Weaker consistency guarantees
- Team less familiar, would require training
- More complex aggregation pipeline vs SQL

**Why Rejected**: Strong consistency is critical for user authentication data.

### Alternative 2: MySQL
**Pros**:
- Team knows it well
- Proven at scale

**Cons**:
- Weaker JSON support than PostgreSQL
- Licensing concerns (Oracle ownership)

**Why Rejected**: PostgreSQL offers superior JSON capabilities we need.

---

## Consequences

### Positive Impacts ‚úÖ
- Better data consistency and integrity
- Flexible JSON fields for user preferences
- Leverage existing team expertise
- Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions

### Negative Impacts / Risks ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Vertical scaling limits (mitigated by sharding plan)
- Requires disciplined connection pool management

### Mitigations
| Risk/Trade-off | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Scaling limits | Design sharding strategy for 1M+ users | @architect |
| Connection pooling | Implement PgBouncer from day 1 | @ops-lead |

---

## Implementation

### Immediate Actions
- [x] Set up PostgreSQL 14 in staging - Owner: @ops-lead - Due: 2025-10-20
- [x] Create database schema - Owner: @tech-lead - Due: 2025-10-22
- [ ] Document backup/recovery procedures - Owner: @ops-lead - Due: 2025-10-25
- [ ] Set up monitoring - Owner: @ops-lead - Due: 2025-10-27

### Implementation Notes
- Use Docker for local development environments
- Enable pgBouncer for connection pooling
- Set up automated backups with 30-day retention
- Use migrations tool (e.g., Flyway or Alembic)

---

## Review

**Review Date**: 2026-04-15 (6 months)  
**Review Criteria**: Revisit if user base exceeds 500K or query performance degrades
