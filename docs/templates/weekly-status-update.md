## Notes for PM

When filling this out:
- Be honest and transparent - early warnings help more than surprises
- Quantify when possible - "deployed 12 features" beats "made progress"
- Highlight changes from last week - what's different?
- Keep it scannable - use bullets, tables, emojis for quick reading
- Link to details - status is a summary, not the full story
- Call out people - recognize contributions publicly
- Make asks specific - "need design review by Friday" vs. "need help with design"

Adjust this template for your audience:
- Leadership: Focus on executive summary, risks, decisions
- Extended team: Include more detail on features and technical progress  
- Core team: Use for alignment on priorities and blockers
