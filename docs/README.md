# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Documentation. This repository serves as the central hub for understanding how OctoAcme manages projects, from initiation through delivery and continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on principles of customer-first delivery, iterative development, and clear ownership. Our processes are designed to enable cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products efficiently while maintaining transparency and fostering psychological safety. We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision, ensuring that our teams can deliver small, testable increments that drive measurable impact.

Our project management framework encompasses well-defined workflows that guide teams through the entire project lifecycle—from initial concept validation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Each phase has clear deliverables, decision gates, and communication touchpoints to ensure alignment across stakeholders. The framework emphasizes data-informed decision-making, with success metrics defined early and tracked throughout the project lifecycle.

Collaboration is at the heart of our approach. We've established clear roles and responsibilities for Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA/Testing professionals, and Stakeholders. Each role has distinct accountabilities while working together to achieve shared outcomes. Communication cadences are structured to provide regular touchpoints—including weekly PM-Product sync meetings, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates—while remaining flexible enough to accommodate project-specific needs.

Quality assurance is integrated throughout our processes, not treated as a separate phase. Teams define acceptance criteria upfront, maintain comprehensive test coverage, and conduct regular code reviews. Our risk management practices emphasize early identification and proactive mitigation, with risks tracked and reviewed consistently. We also prioritize continuous improvement through blameless retrospectives that capture learnings and translate them into actionable improvements for future projects.
